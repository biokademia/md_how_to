# Molecular dynamics with python

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/md-how-to/badge/?version=latest)](http://md-how-to.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Tutorial describing detailed workflow for creating and analyzing trajectories produced by the most popular simulation packages using vanila python and open source Python libraries..

What you will learn:

* what are most popular tools to do MD
* popular data formats and python tools to work with them
* how to prepare robust and easy to set up work environment
* how to build MD system
* how to run MD simulations using most popuar packages
* how to dock small ligands
* how to scale up/out your simulations
* how to load a structure or a MD trajectory (popular formats)
* how to select parts of your system
* how to work with atoms, residues and molecules
* how to deal with large data-sets (bigger than RAM)
* how to analyze MD trajectories
* how to write out or convert trajectories
* how to use various algorithms in analysis (clusterization, structure, ML)
* how to build interactive visualizations
